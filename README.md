# .template.git

easy to start template repo gathering all the efforts and scripts, with the attempt of standardising ML4Q Research Data Management guidelines...

# Sounce (.src)

- **header:** contains headers for tex
- **.bib/**
    - **bib.tex:** this is the central tex file to manage inclusion/exclusion of all .bib files (normally I split them per topic/authors, this practice is better than using one humongous refs.bib as it decreases biber runtime, and it makes it easier to reuse .bib files for later projects)   

## Automations:

(_Note: the following files are hidden but can be executed from terminal as commands_)

- **.vscode/settings.json:** vscode file to hide all the auxiliary files and scripts from the workspace. (Need to write explanation on how to manipulate)
- **gitpush.bat:** simple script to push in git, asks for commit names.
- **.bat/**
    - **auxclean.bat:** cleans all the auxiliary files generated by pdflatex from everywhere in the repo.
