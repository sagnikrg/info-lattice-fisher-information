\section{Information Lattice}

Building on the works in \cite{Bardarson2022TimeEvolutionSciPostPhys} The \textit{Information Lattice} as a concept to systematically analyze the information content and entanglement structure of a quantum many-body state was first introduced by Artiaco et. al. in \cite{Artiaco2024EfficientLargePRXQuantum}, and further developed as a tool for dynamics, charecterisation of loclisation, rate of information scrambling, criticality of the localisation-scrambling transition, and quench dynamics respectively in \cite{Artiaco2024EfficientLargePRXQuantum,Artiaco2024UltraslowGrowthPhysRevLett,Artiaco2025UniversalCharacterizationPhysRevLett,Artiaco2025LocalInformationPhysRevA}. Here for the sake of completeness, we quote the construction of information lattice and some properties possibily useful to us from the aforementioned works.
